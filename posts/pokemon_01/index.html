<p>Before we start, I should really explain what the uncanny valley effect is. What it boils down to is a relationship between an objects degree of resemblance to a human and the emotional response the object creates in humans. The &ldquo;Uncanny&rdquo; part of the hypothesis details the feeling of coldness and unrest a human will feel when confronted with something that imperfectly resembles an actual human being, such as a creepy anamatronic with a prosthetic flesh mask.</p>

<p>You might be asking yourself how exactly this ties into the new generation pokemon series? In the year 2000 pokemon transitioned from being 2D top down to being 3D for the first time. At the time people could overlook the lack of realism as technological bottle necks but now it is harder to overlook due to pokemon leaning more heavily into the open world genre.</p>

      <figcaption class="center" >Hulbury town from Pokemon Sword and Shield</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>I&rsquo;d like to examine a few things in this screenshot, first off the art style. it heavily leans into a cartoonish but realistic style for both the humans and the surroundings. This leads to our first big problem, Roads. Throughout the game we see these roads designed for cars yet there are no cars to be seen. This puts the user off, if they are meant to go everywhere with a bike then why would you build car paths. On the other hand there are examples of cities where there are cars but no roads and that is a further flaw of the world bulding. However for most people this could be overlooked which brings me to my next point.</p>
<p>Empty houses. Throughout the world of Sword and Shield the houses are highly decorated, yet most the houses in a specific town will either be inaccessible or will have the same furniture in every house. This is another way of breaking immersion.</p>
<h1 id="old-vs-new">
  Old VS New
  <a href="#old-vs-new" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a>
</h1>
<p>You may be thinking that these are just nitpicks and normally you would be right, but id like to showcase one way in which the new games break immersion by using an example from the old games.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/img/2022/pokemon/ExhibitB.jpg"   />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >Player Character Pokemon Fire red</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>Lets examine this picture, our player character, the small guy in red, can only move in four directions. Obviously we can not expect much more since a D-pad is limited to 4 directions. this makes perfect sense in the context of the old games because there are no more directions. It is physically impossible to make it any more &ldquo;immersive&rdquo;. When the player passes another character that NPC will snap towards the player and either move towards them or initiate convversation, there is nothing wrong with this because again there is no way for a character to naturally turn they have to snap to the player.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve examined the limitations of the old pokemon games we have to ask ourselves why do the new games still have this functionality? Dont believe me? Go boot up pokemon Sword and Shield or pull up a youtube video and find a section where the player passes by and gets interrupted by an NPC. They will still snap towards the player and approach them. It is so jarring when the player character can move in 360 degrees of movement while the NPCs remain as if they are stuck in a 2D game. Furthermore the NPCs are still placed around in the philosphy of a 2D game. Why is it in a 3D open world / adventure game there are NPCs in the middle of the road doing nothing but waiting for a player to pass by so they can snap towards them and feed them dialogue. It feels wrong.</p>
<p>But i digress, enough nitpicking lets move on.</p>

  <figure class="center" >
    <img src="/img/2022/pokemon/ExhibitC.jpg"   />
    
      <figcaption class="center" >Team Rocket grunt Fire red</figcaption>
    
  </figure>


<p>This is a grunt of Team Rockets&rsquo; from Pokemon Fire red. While we go into this next section i&rsquo;d like to point out the fact that in the old games all team rocket or plasma grunts looked the same. This didnt really matter because we know these arent actual &ldquo;people&rdquo; but representations of people.</p>

   <figure class="center" >
     <img src="/img/2022/pokemon/ExhibitD.jpg"   />
     
       <figcaption class="center" >Team Flare grunt Pokemon XY</figcaption>
     
   </figure>
 

<p>Lets examine this next screenshot, this is team Flare of pokemon XY. Would you like to know the difference now? There is a male and female model.That&rsquo;s the only change they all look the same even when they&rsquo;re in a group its just one male and female model copy pasted into a group. Did they all have plastic surgery? In a game where most of the NPCs in towns are unique is it too much to ask for that the main enemy also has unique character models? Not only does it break the immersion, it feels cheap and it bogs down any cutscenes or scene making it look like a copy pasted mess. It simply makes no sense in a 3D world.</p>
<p>Before i finish let me show you an example of 2D game done right in 3D.</p>

   <figure class="center" >
     <img src="/img/2022/pokemon/ExhibitE.jpg"   />
     
       <figcaption class="center" >Legend of Zelda: Link&rsquo;s Awakening remaster</figcaption>
     
   </figure>
 

<p>Notice how this is a 2D game remastered in 3D, The reason why this game doesnt feel so out of touch is because it looks like a cartoon. Link moves like a cartoon. the enemies move like a cartoon. There is a uniform art style and direction, They all act according how you would expect in this type of enviorment and style.</p>
<p>On the other hand the pokemon games present a broken narrative and the characters do not act like they are in 3D. The best way I could sum it up is that the new pokemon games has a 3D enviorment while the characters and world building is still in 2D and that not only breaks immersion it makes the game look lazy.</p>
<p>You could argue im nitpicking for the sake of nitpicking and thats okay. If you&rsquo;ve reached this far then thank you for reading.</p>
